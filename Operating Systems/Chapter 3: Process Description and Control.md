#### What is an instruction trace?
#### What common events lead to the creation of a process?
A process is typically created when the OS is provided with a new batch job, a user logs on to the system, the OS creates it to perform a function on behalf of a user program, or it is spawned by an exsiting process. 
#### For the processing model of figure 3.6, briefly define each state.
Figure 3.6 describes a five-state process model. The states are:
New: This is a process which has been created but has not yet been added to the pool of processes on which work can be done upon.
Ready: This is a process which is in the pool of processes that can be worked on, but is not currently being worked on by the cpu.
Blocked: This is a process which is waiting for an event before work on it can continue.
Running: This is a process which the cpu is currently working on.
Exit: This is a process which has been released from the pool of processes which can be worked upon, either because it has completed or because it aborted for some reason.
#### What does it mean to preemt a process?
#### What is swapping and what is its purpose?
#### Why does Figure 3.9b have two blocked states?
#### List four characteristics of a suspended process.
#### For what types of entities does the OS maintain tables of information for management purposes?
#### List three general categories of information in a process control block.
#### Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?
#### What are the steps performed by an OS to create a new process?
#### What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?
#### Give three examples of an interrupt.
#### What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?
